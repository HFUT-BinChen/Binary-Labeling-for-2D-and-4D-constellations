## Binary Labeling for 2D and 4D constellations

The content below is base on our student's internship report, which was titled 'Binary Labeling for 2D and 4D constellations'.

### Introduction

The binary labeling of constellations is an important factor to the achievable information rate (AIR) of a constellation. Although normally the mutual information (MI) is used to determine the AIR of a constellation, when the binary labeling is taken into account the GMI is used as described in this publication (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10393). To calculate both the MI and GMI the Gauss-Hermite approximation is used. The SNR used in the report is defined in the same way as in the same publication as before.  

The algorithm used to determine a good labeling for the constellations is the binary switching algorithm (BSA) as described in this paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/64657/authors#authors). The cost function used in the BSA is described in the publication (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6784555?tp=&amp;arnumber=6784555).  The constellations for which the BSA was executed were all taken from this website (https://codes.se/packings/).
